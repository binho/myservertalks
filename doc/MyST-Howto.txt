cp -R MyServerTalks /usr/local


SETUP:
------------

At /usr/local/MyServerTalks/etc you will find 3 files:

config.ini - Server contact information
contacts.ini - Contacts configuration
modules.ini - Extensions configuration


1. Configure your server jabber/gmail account as config.ini:

[jaccount]
user = zetrovao@jabber.org
pass = 123deoliveira4

replace zetrovao@jabber.org with your server account (ex: mywonderfulserver@gmail.com) and with your password. Be carefull with file permissions, perform chmod 400 config.ini is a good option.

2. Configure the contactlist that will be able to talk to server at contacts.ini:

[andrei.mosman@gmail.com]
status = disabled
super-secret = thewho

[cleberwillian@gmail.com]
status = disabled
super-secret = 1millionbucks

The super-secret defined for each user will be used to access an special escope (hi-level escope) leave it blank to disable the super access. The status field indicates is this contact is enabled or disabled.

3. Configure extensions at modules.ini

The extensions provides a way to expand your server talking. With extensions you can, for example, call some script or binary that do an specific thing that may interest to you. 

You can configure internal functions (that will be processed inside MyServerTalks) as you can se:

[LIST]
type=internal
call=
escope=super
status=enabled

[CHDIR]
type=internal
call=
escope=super
status=enabled


Here an simple explanation:

[LIST]  	--> define the name that user will call at messenger window
type = internal --> indicate that this command (list) will be processed by internal (core) MyST processor
call= 		--> this parameter interest only to internal functions
esciope=super 	--> this command can only be performed by SUPER escope.
status=enabled 	--> this command is enabled to use.


But you can also expand your system to perform anything that interest you. 

[TEST]  		--> define the name that user will call at messenger window: test
type = external 	--> indicate that this command (test) will be processed by external MyST processor
call= test.sh		--> the name of an binary or script located at /usr/local/MyServerTalks/extensions/external that will be called
esciope=user,super 	--> this command can only be performed by USER (initial escope) and SUPER escope.
status=enabled 		--> this command is enabled to use.

Now you can create a shell script /usr/local/MyServerTalks/extensions/external/test.sh with something like this:

#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello World... How are you?"




Adjust the permissons (chmod +x /usr/local/MyServerTalks/extensions/external/test.sh) and start MyST.py. When one of the enabled contacts execute "test" the script test.sh will be called.



4. Start the server:

python /usr/local/MyServerTalks/MyST.py



You probly will receive an authorization request on your enabled contacts (vide contacts.ini).

ESCOPE
---------

Now, that you know modules.conf you wanna know what-the-fucking is escope? Whell, escope is an escope to command execution. You can see in what escope you are by typing at your messenger:

escope

to change to SUPER escope you can use:

escope SUPER yoursecrethere

to change back to USER escope try:

escope USER






EXTRA INFO: How MyST send parameters to external modules/apps ???
------------------------------------------------------------------




MyST execute de command by pipe open with some parameters:

"contact@host" "escope" "command" "parameters;separated by;coma"

To our test example MyST execute:

/usr/local/MyServerTalks/extensions/external/test.sh "contact@gmail.com" "user" ""

if user has typed something like "test 123 456" MyST execute:

/usr/local/MyServerTalks/extensions/external/test.sh "contact@gmail.com" "user" "123;456"



OTHER INFORMATIONS
--------------------

MyST is an small project, with simply development but with no limits to grow-up. With MyST you the sky is the limit. You can do anything you want using a Messenger client.


Enjoy
